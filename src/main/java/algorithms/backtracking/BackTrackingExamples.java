   * 10.
   * Problem: Tug of War.
   * Given a set of n integers, divide the set in two subsets of n/2 sizes each such that the difference of the sum of
   * two subsets is as minimum as possible. If n is even, then sizes of two subsets must be strictly n/2 and if n is
   * odd, then size of one subset must be (n-1)/2 and size of other subset must be (n+1)/2.
   * Solution: Try every possible subset of half size. If one subset of half size is formed, the remaining elements
   * form the other subset. We check whether this solutions is better than the best solution available so far.
   * If it is, then we update the best solution.
