    /**
     * Counting sort is an algorithm for sorting a collection of objects according to keys that are small integers;
     * that is, it is an integer sorting algorithm. It operates by counting the number of objects that have each
     * distinct key value, and using arithmetic on those counts to determine the positions of each key value in the
     * output sequence. Its running time is linear in the number of items and the difference between the maximum and
     * minimum key values, so it is only suitable for direct use in situations where the variation in keys is not
     * significantly greater than the number of items.
     * Because counting sort uses key values as indexes into an array, it is not a comparison sort, and the Î©(n log n)
     * lower bound for comparison sorting does not apply to it.
