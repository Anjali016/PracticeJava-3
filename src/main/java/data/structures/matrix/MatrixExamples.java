   *
   * Solution:
   * 1.Use Binary Search Tree.
   *      Find the decimal equivalent of each row and insert it into BST. Each node of the BST will contain two
   *      fields, one field for the decimal value, other for row number. Do not insert a node if it is duplicated.
   *      Finally, traverse the BST and print the corresponding rows.
   * 2. Use Trie data structure.
   *      Since the matrix is boolean, a variant of Trie data structure can be used where each node will be having
   *      two children one for 0 and other for 1. Insert each row in the Trie. If the row is already there, donâ€™t
   *      print the row. If row is not there in Trie, insert it in Trie and print it.

   * Problem: Collect maximum coins before hitting a dead end

   'C' -->  This cell has coin

   '#' -->  This cell is a blocking cell.
   We can not go anywhere from this.

   'E' -->  This cell is empty. We don't get
   a coin, but we can move from here.
   Initial position is cell (0, 0) and initial direction is right.

   Following are rules for movements across cells.

   If face is Right, then we can move to below cells

   1. Move one step ahead, i.e., cell (i, j+1) and direction remains right.
   2. Move one step down and face left, i.e., cell (i+1, j) and direction becomes left.
   If face is Left, then we can move to below cells

   1. Move one step ahead, i.e., cell (i, j-1) and direction remains left.
   2. Move one step down and face right, i.e., cell (i+1, j) and direction becomes right.
   Final position can be anywhere and final direction can also be anything. The target is to collect maximum coins.
