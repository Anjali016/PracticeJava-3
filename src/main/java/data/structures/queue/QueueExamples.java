  /**
   * 6.
   * Problem: Implement Queue using Stacks.
   * Solution:
   * By making deQueue operation costly:
   * enQueue(q,  x)
   *   1) Push x to stack1 (assuming size of stacks is unlimited).
   * deQueue(q)
   *   1) If both stacks are empty then error.
   *   2) If stack2 is empty
   *      While stack1 is not empty, push everything from stack1 to stack2.
   *   3) Pop the element from stack2 and return it.
